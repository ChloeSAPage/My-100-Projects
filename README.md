# My-100-Projects
My projects completed by following the Udemy Course '100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023'

Each project is attempted solo, using only the knowledge of what the project is and the end result. Only after this or if I get stuck will I look at the videos and follow along.
